		"description": "This tutorial is an introduction to [FIWARE Keyrock](http://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - a generic enabler which introduces\n**Identity Management** into FIWARE services. The tutorial explains how to create users and organizations in preparation to assign\nroles and permissions to them in a later tutorial.\n\nThe `docker-compose` files for this tutorial can be found on GitHub: \n\n![GitHub](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Identity-Management/icon/GitHub-Mark-32px.png) [FIWARE 401: Identity Management](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.Identity-Management)\n\n# Identity Management\n\n> \"If one meets a powerful person — ask them five questions: ‘What power have you got?\n> Where did you get it from? In whose interests do you exercise it? To whom are you\n> accountable? And how can we get rid of you?’\"\n>\n> — Anthony Wedgwood Benn (The Five Essential Questions of Democracy)\n\n\nIn computer security terminology, Identity management is the security and business discipline that \"enables the right\nindividuals to access the right resources at the right times and for the right reasons\". It addresses the need to\nensure appropriate access to resources across disparate systems.\n\nThe FIWARE framework consists of a series of separate components, and the security chapter aims to implement\nthe common needs of these components regarding who (or what) gets to access which resources within the system,\nbut before access to resources can be locked down, the identity of the person (or service) making the request\nneeds to be known. The FIWARE **Keyrock** Generic Enabler sets up all of the common characteristics of an\nIdentity Management System out-of-the-box, so that other components are able to use standard authentication\nmechanisms to  accept or reject requests based on industry standard protocols.\n\nIdentity Management therefore covers the issues of how to gain an identity within the system, the protection\nof that identity and the surrounding technologies such as passwords and network protocols.\n\n## Standard Concepts of Identity Management\n\nThe following common objects are found with the **Keyrock** Identity Management database:\n\n* **User** - Any signed up user able to identify themselves with an eMail and password. Users can be assigned\n rights individually or as a group\n* **Application** -  Any securable FIWARE application consisting of a series of microservices\n* **Organization** - A group of users who can be assigned a series of rights. Altering the rights of the organization\n effects the access of all users of that organization\n* **OrganizationRole** - Users can either be members or admins of an organization - Admins are able to add and remove users\n from their organization, members merely gain the roles and permissions of an organization. This allows each organization\n to be responsible for their members and removes the need for a super-admin to administer all rights\n* **Role** - A role is a descriptive bucket for a set of permissions. A role can be assigned to either a single user\n or an organization. A signed-in user gains all the permissions from all of their own roles plus all of the roles associated\n to their organization\n* **Permission** - An ability to do something on a resource within the system\n\nAdditionally two further non-human application objects can be secured within a FIWARE application:\n\n* **IoTAgent** - a proxy between IoT Sensors and  the Context Broker\n* **PEPProxy** - a middleware for use between generic enablers challenging the rights of a user.\n\n\n The relationship between the objects can be seen below:\n\n![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Identity-Management/img/entities.png)\n\n## OAuth2\n\n**Keyrock** uses [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) to enable third-party applications\nto obtain limited access to services. **OAuth2** is the open standard for access delegation to\ngrant access rights. It allows notifying a resource provider (e.g. the Knowage Generic Enabler)\nthat the resource  owner (e.g. you) grants permission to a third-party (e.g. a Knowage Application)\naccess to their information (e.g. the list of entities).\n\nThere are several common OAuth 2.0 grant flows, the details of which can be found below:\n\n* [Authorization Code](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code)\n* [Implicit](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit)\n* [Password](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/password)\n* [Client Credentials](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/client-credentials)\n* [Device Code](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/device-code)\n* [Refresh Token](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/refresh-token)\n\nThe primary concept is that both **Users**  and **Applications** must first identify themselves using\na standard OAuth2 Challenge-Response mechanism. Thereafter a user is assigned a token which they\nappend to every subsequent request. This token identifies the user, the application and the rights the\nuser is able to exercise.  **Keyrock** can then be used with other enablers can be used to limit and\nlock-down access. The details of the access flows are discussed below and in subsequent tutorials.\n\nThe reasoning behind OAuth2 is that you never need to expose your own user name and password to a\nthird party to give them  full access - you merely permit the relevant access which can be either Read-Only\nor Read-Write and such access can be defined down to a granular level. Furthermore there is provision for\nrevoking access at any time, leaving the resource owner in control of who can access what.\n\n\n# Prerequisites\n\n## Docker\n\nTo keep things simple both components will be run using [Docker](https://www.docker.com). **Docker** is a\ncontainer technology which allows to different components isolated into their respective environments.\n\n* To install Docker on Windows follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)\n* To install Docker on Mac follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)\n* To install Docker on Linux follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/)\n\n**Docker Compose** is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. A\n[YAML file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiware/tutorials.Entity-Relationships/master/docker-compose.yml) is used\nconfigure the required services for the application. This means all container services can be brought up in a single\ncommand. Docker Compose is installed by default as part of Docker for Windows and  Docker for Mac, however Linux users\nwill need to follow the instructions found  [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)\n\n## Cygwin\n\nWe will start up our services using a simple bash script. Windows users should download [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) to provide a\ncommand line functionality similar to a Linux distribution on Windows.\n\n# Architecture\n\nThis introduction will only make use of one FIWARE component - the [Keyrock](http://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/)\nIdentity Management Generic Enabler. Usage of **Keyrock** alone alone is insufficient for an application to qualify\n as *“Powered by FIWARE”*.  Additionally will be persisting user data in a **MySQL**  database.\n\n\nThe overall architecture will consist of the following elements:\n\n* One **FIWARE Generic Enabler**:\n    * FIWARE [Keyrock](http://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/) offer a complement Identity Management System including:\n        * An OAuth2 authentication system for Applications and Users\n        * A website graphical front-end for Identity Management Administration\n        * An equivalent REST API for Identity Management via HTTP requests\n\n* One [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database :\n    * Used to persist user identities, applications, roles and permissions\n\n\nSince all interactions between the elements are initiated by HTTP requests, the entities can be containerized and run from exposed ports.\n\n\n![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Identity-Management/img/architecture.png)\n\nThe specific architecture of each section of the tutorial is discussed below.\n\n## Keyrock Configuration\n\n```yaml\n  idm:\n    image: fiware-idm\n    container_name: idm\n    hostname: idm\n    depends_on:\n      - mysql-db\n    ports:\n      - \"3005:3005\"\n    networks:\n      default:\n    environment:\n      - DATABASE_HOST=mysql-db\n      - IDM_DB_PASS_FILE=/run/secrets/my_secret_data\n      - IDM_DB_USER=root\n      - IDM_HOST=http://localhost:3005\n      - IDM_PORT=3005\n    secrets:\n      - my_secret_data\n```\n\nThe `idm` container is a web application server listening on a single port:\n\n* Port `3005` has been  exposed for HTTP traffic so we can display the web page and interact with the REST API.\n\n> **Note** The HTTP protocols is being used for demonstration purposes only.\n> In a production environment, all OAuth2 Authentication should occur over HTTPS, to avoid sending\n> any sensitive information using plain-text.\n\nThe `idm` container is driven by environment variables as shown:\n\n| Key |Value|Description|\n|-----|-----|-----------|\n|IDM_DB_PASS|`idm`| Password of the attached MySQL Database - secured by **Docker Secrets** (see below) |\n|IDM_DB_USER|`root`|User name of the default MySQL user - left in plain-text |\n|IDM_HOST|`http://localhost:3005`| Host name of the **Keyrock**  App Server - used in activation eMails when signing up users|\n|IDM_PORT|`3005`| Port used by the **Keyrock** App Server  - this has been altered from the default 3000 port to avoid clashes |\n\n\n> :information_source: **Note** that this example has secured the MySQL password using **Docker Secrets**\n> By using `IDM_DB_PASS` with the `_FILE` suffix and referring to a secrets file location.\n> This avoids exposing the password as an `ENV` variable in plain-text - either in the `Dockerfile` Image or\n> as an injected variable which could be read using `docker inspect`.\n>\n> The following list of variables (where used) should be set via secrets with the  `_FILE` suffix  in a Production System:\n>\n> * `IDM_SESSION_SECRET`\n> * `IDM_ENCRYPTION_KEY`\n> * `IDM_DB_PASS`\n> * `IDM_DB_USER`\n> * `IDM_ADMIN_ID`\n> * `IDM_ADMIN_USER`\n> * `IDM_ADMIN_EMAIL`\n> * `IDM_ADMIN_PASS`\n> * `IDM_EX_AUTH_DB_USER`\n> * `IDM_EX_AUTH_DB_PASS`\n\n\n\n## MySQL Configuration\n\n```yaml\n  mysql-db:\n    image: mysql:5.7\n    hostname: mysql-db\n    container_name: db-mysql\n    expose:\n      - \"3306\"\n    ports:\n      - \"3306:3306\"\n    networks:\n      default:\n    environment:\n      - \"MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/my_secret_data\"\n      - \"MYSQL_ROOT_HOST=172.18.1.5\"\n    volumes:\n      - mysql-db:/var/lib/mysql\n    secrets:\n      - my_secret_data\n```\n\n\nThe `mysql-db` container is listening on a single port:\n\n* Port `3306` is the default port for a MySQL server. It has been exposed so you can also run other database tools to display data if you wish\n\nThe `mysql-db` container is driven by environment variables as shown:\n\n| Key               |Value.    |Description                               |\n|-------------------|----------|------------------------------------------|\n|MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD|`123`.    | specifies a password that is set for the MySQL `root` account - secured by **Docker Secrets** (see below)|\n|MYSQL_ROOT_HOST    |`root`| By default, MySQL creates the `root'@'localhost` account. This account can only be connected to from inside the container. Setting this environment variable allows root connections from other hosts |\n\n# Start Up\n\nTo start the installation, do the following:\n\n```console\ngit clone git@github.com:Fiware/tutorials.Identity-Management.git\ncd tutorials.Identity-Management\n\n./services create\n```\n\n>**Note** The initial creation of Docker images can take up to three minutes\n\n\nThereafter, all services can be initialized from the command line by running the [services](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.Identity-Management/blob/master/services) Bash script provided within the repository:\n\n```console\n./services <command>\n```\n\nWhere `<command>` will vary depending upon the exercise we wish to activate.\n\n>:information_source: **Note:** If you want to clean up and start over again you can do so with the following command:\n>\n>```console\n>./services stop\n>```\n>\n\n\n### Reading directly from the Keyrock MySQL Database\n\nAll Identify Management records  and relationships are held within the the attached MySQL database. This can be\naccessed by entering the running Docker container as shown:\n\n```console\ndocker exec -it db-mysql bash\n```\n\n```console\nmysql -u <user> -p<password> idm\n```\n\nWhere `<user>` and `<password>` match the values defined in the `docker-compose` file for `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`\nand `MYSQL_ROOT_USER`. The default values for the tutorial are usually `root` and `secret`.\n\nSQL commands can then be entered from the command line. e.g.:\n\n```SQL\nselect id, username, email, password from user;\n```\n\n\n### UUIDs within Keyrock\n\nAll IDs and tokens within  **Keyrock** are subject to change. The following values will need to be amended when\nquerying for records. Record IDs use Universally Unique Identifiers - UUIDs.\n\n| Key |Description                        | Sample Value |\n|-----|-----------------------------------|--------------|\n|`keyrock`| URL for the location of the **Keyrock** service|`localhost:3005`|\n|`X-Auth-token`| Token received in the Header when logging in as a user - in other words *\"Who am I?\"* |`51f2e380-c959-4dee-a0af-380f730137c3`|\n|`X-Subject-token`|Token added to requests to define *\"Who do I want to inquire about?\"* - This can also be a repeat the `X-Auth-token` defined above |`51f2e380-c959-4dee-a0af-380f730137c3`|\n|`user-id`| id of an existing user, found with the `user`  table |`96154659-cb3b-4d2d-afef-18d6aec0518e`|\n|`organization-id`| id of an existing organization, found with the `organization`  table |`e424ed98-c966-46e3-b161-a165fd31bc01`|\n|`organization-role-id`| type of role a user has within an organization either `owner` or `member`|`member`|\n\nTokens are designed to expire after a set period.

			"description": "For any identity management system of a reasonable size, it is useful to be able to assign\nroles to groups of users, rather than setting them up individually. Since user administration\nis a time consuming business, it is also necessary to be able to delegate the responsibility\nof managing these group of users down to other accounts with a lower level of access.\n\nConsider our supermarket chain for example, there could be a group of users (Managers) who\ncan change the prices of products within the store, and another group of users (Store Detectives)\nwho can lock and unlock door after closing time. Rather than give access to each individual account,\nit would be easier to assign the rights to an organization and then add users to the groups.\n\nFurthermore, Alice, the **Keyrock** administrator does not need to explicitly add additional user\naccounts to each organization herself  - she could delegate that right to an owner within each organization.\nFor example Bob the Regional Manager would be made the owner of the *management* organization and could\nadd and remove addition manager accounts (such as `manager1` and `manager2`) to that organization\nwhereas Charlie the Head of Security could be handed an ownership  role in the *security* organization and add\nadditional store detectives to that organization.\n\nNote that Bob does not have the rights to alter the membership list of the *security* organization and\nCharlie does not have the rights to alter the membership list of the *management* organization.\nFurthermore neither Bob nor Charlie would be able to alter the permissions of the application themselves,\nmerely add and remove existing user accounts to the organization they control.\n\nCreating an application and setting-up the permissions is not covered here as it is the subject of the next tutorial.",
