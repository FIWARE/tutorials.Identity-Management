# WARNING: Do not deploy this tutorial configuration directly to a production environment
#
# The tutorial docker-compose files have not been written for production deployment and will not 
# scale. A proper architecture has been sacrificed to keep the narrative focused on the learning 
# goals, they are just used to deploy everything onto a single Docker machine. All FIWARE components 
# are running at full debug and extra ports have been exposed to allow for direct calls to services. 
# They also contain various obvious security flaws - passwords in plain text, no load balancing,
# no use of HTTPS and so on. 
# 
# This is all to avoid the need of multiple machines, generating certificates, encrypting secrets
# and so on, purely so that a single docker-compose file can be read as an example to build on, 
# not use directly. 
# 
# When deploying to a production environment, please looking at the SmartSDK Recipes
# in order to scale up to a proper architecture:
